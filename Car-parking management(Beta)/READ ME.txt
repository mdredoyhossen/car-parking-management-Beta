Title: Car Parking Management System (Beta Version)

Introduction:
Welcome to the Car Parking Management System, a revolutionary project developed during the 3rd semester by Md Redoy Hossen at the IUBAT-International University Of Business Agriculture And Technology. This beta version showcases the potential of a comprehensive parking management system created exclusively using the C++ programming language.

Features and Functionalities:

User Registration:
- The system offers two distinct panels: Admin and Worker. To access either of them, users must create an account.
- During registration, users provide essential information such as name, email, username, contact number, and password.
- Password validation is ensured through a recheck system, prompting users to re-enter their password if it doesn't match the first entry.

Admin Panel:
1. Total Parked Cars:
   - Admins can access real-time data on the number of parked cars, distinguishing between those currently parked and those not parked.
   - Detailed information about car owners is available.

2. Total Earnings and Price Setting:
   - Admins can view the total earnings generated from parked cars.
   - Additionally, they have the authority to set parking prices.

3. Worker Details:
   - Admins can easily review the details of all registered workers.
   - Future versions will include a scheduling system to prevent time conflicts among workers.

4. Car Search:
   - Admins can search for specific cars by providing the car number.
   - Detailed car user information and parking status are displayed.

Worker Panel:
1. Car Entry:
   - Workers can input car owner details, including name, contact number, email, car model, car number, and parking hours.
   - The system automatically calculates the parking amount.
   - Workers verify the provided information before successfully parking the car.

2. Car Exit:
   - For car exit, workers need to provide the car number.
   - Future versions will resolve the issue of handling multiple cars with the same number.

3. Car Search:
   - Workers can search for cars using the car number.
   - Detailed car information is displayed upon search.

4. Logout:
   - Logging out returns users to the home page.

Upcoming Enhancements:
- Future versions will incorporate advanced features such as time tracking and worker IDs.
- The project will include an automatic file creation system for essential files.
- A scheduling system for worker registration will be implemented to avoid time conflicts.

Conclusion:
The Car Parking Management System, in its beta version, demonstrates the foundation of a robust and efficient parking management solution. Developed by Md Redoy Hossen, this project showcases the potential for more advanced iterations, promising even greater functionality and convenience for administrators and workers alike.
